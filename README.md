# Gewirrenth
An infinite dungeon crawler, that somewhat defies the laws of physics

The game features 
  * Elves - low health creatures that drop powerful potions
  * Goblins - Hard hitting and slow monsters that drop their powerful swords
  * Trolls - Fast and tough enemies which drop powerful damaging potions
  
## Building
The build process was developed for Linux, but it should be rather easy to make a version for Windows and MacOS later.
